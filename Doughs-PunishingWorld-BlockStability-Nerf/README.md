**Description:**
This mod is not for everyone, please read this!

This modlet adds lowers the block stability of several block types quite a bit.
Blocks will not hold as much weight, horizontally, and thus buildings/POIs/player
built structures will likely suffer collapses much more/easier than usual.
Building will be more difficult as long horizontal runs of blocks in the air will not be possible,
and you must have more horizontal support below to support blocks.

NOTE: POI's do not appear to collapse without first being "hit", meaning it appears that
block support/stability is only calculated once a block is destroyed (by a player or a zed, etc).
so an existing POI may violate stability rules but it will not take effect until block(s) within the POI
are destroyed. This means a POI may have large amount of collapse/disintegration by simply destroying 1
block, even a decorative one.

NOTE: On a multiplayer server, this mod may cause what looks like "drop mining" as
buildings (and possibly ground blocks) will likely start falling/collapsing with very little
initial block damage.


Generally:
The "strength" or "horizantal stability" is less than 50% odf the vanilla settings, with some adjustments
made to be this "order of strength".  The "mass/weight" of the blocks is not changed, just how much weight
a block can hold, horizontally.

The carrying capacity" if you will,  generally will follow these rules, which are mostly "the block upgrade path"
when a block can be upgraded.
glass < wood < weak or thin metal|cobblestone < stone < metal < brick|bulletproof glass < concrete < iron < steel < stainless steel
